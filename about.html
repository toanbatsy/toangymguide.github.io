			<h1>Training Styles for pure Hypertrophy</h1>
			<p>
				<em>Please learn about this training style prior to your workout</em> First, we have to talk about range of motion. For pure muscle growth, your muscles need to experience a full range of motion. Extend your muscles so that they are fully stretched at the bottom, and then bring the weights up until the muscles are contracted. 
			<p>
				The second thing is lifting tempo. Don't just focus on getting the weight up. The lowering phase of the lift is just as important! The lowering phase of a rep should last around 2 to 4 seconds. It doesn't have to be slow, but it has to be controlled. Think about your muscles tearing apart in the negative. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, we need to talk about our excersise selection. You need to choose excersises that allow you experience a full range of motion. That said, you need a deep stretch at the bottom and a good contraction at the top.

				<em> Why learning about training styles? </em>
				Sure, you can get away with poor form and technique in training. But I doubt those gains are optimal. These training styles have been researched and backed by science for a few years now so you can totally trust in these strategies and start applying these techniques into your training.
