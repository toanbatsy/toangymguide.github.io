				<h1>About my journey</h1>
				<p>
				I started lifting when I was in grade 12th. Back then, I didn't love the gym as much as I do now. Whenever I came back from school, my mom took me to the gym on the way home. I was there without a goal, a purpose. I did what I saw everyone was doing. But then, one day my brother showed up in the gym and taught me the true "newbie" phase, my love for the gym started growing. I started to look forward to the soreness the next day after a workout. I started to like the pain the leg press gave me because that it when my mind completely shut off to fully focus on the lift. 
				</p>
				<p>
				I love the gym so much that I promised myself to not miss a day. I love every scream, every grunt I make when I do a huge lift. I started to chase pound after pound, looking forward to increase the weight on every excersise. At first, I could only bench the barbell. But now I can bench 90kg. 
				</p>
				<p>
				I hope that after visiting this website, you'll start fiding your true passion in life. It doesn't have to be the gym. I want you to find something you enjoy doing, something you loving doing it so much that as if the world would collapse if you don't do it.
